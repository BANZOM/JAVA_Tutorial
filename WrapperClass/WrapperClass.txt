In Java, a wrapper class is a class that provides an object-oriented representation of a primitive data type. 
The seven primitive data types in Java are byte, short, int, long, float, double, and boolean. Wrapper classes allow these primitive data types to be treated as objects.

The wrapper classes in Java are:

    Byte
    Short
    Integer
    Long
    Float
    Double
    Boolean
    Character

Wrapper classes are useful when working with collections, as collections can only contain objects and not primitive data types. 
They also provide utility methods for converting between primitive data types and their object counterparts, as well as methods for performing mathematical operations on numeric values.
