Access modifiers are used in object-oriented programming languages like Java to control 
the visibility and accessibility of class members such as fields, methods, and inner classes.

-The public access modifier makes the member accessible to all classes in the same package or in any other package.

-The private access modifier restricts access to the member to only the class that declares it.

-The protected access modifier allows access to the member by the class that declares it and its subclasses.

-The default access modifier, also known as package-private, is used when no access modifier is specified. 
 It restricts access to the member to only the classes in the same package.



General Idea:
- make classes public
- make variables private
- methods are most of the time public
- make method protected only if you want to use it with subclasses
- Avoid using default
