Final keyword:

In Java, "final" is a keyword that can be used to declare a variable, a method or a class.

When used to declare a variable, the "final" keyword indicates that the value of that variable cannot be changed once it has been assigned a value. This makes the variable a constant.
For example:

'''
final int MAX_VALUE = 100;
'''

In this code, the variable "MAX_VALUE" has been declared as final, so its value cannot be changed once it has been initialized to 100.



When used to declare a method, the "final" keyword indicates that the method cannot be overridden by any subclass. Therefore, the implementation of the method is fixed and cannot be modified in a subclass.
So we can also say that it is used to stop method overrides when used with method. 
For example:

'''
public class ParentClass {
    public final void printMessage() {
        System.out.println("This message cannot be changed by a subclass");
    }
}
'''
'''
public class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
    // This will result in a compile-time error
    public void printMessage() {
        System.out.println("This message overrides the parent method");
    }
}
'''

Finally, when used to declare a class, the "final" keyword indicates that the class cannot be extended by any subclass. Therefore, the class is sealed and cannot be modified or subclassed further.
So we can also say that it is used to stop inheritance when used with class
For example:

'''
public final class FinalClass {
    // Class implementation here
}

// This will result in a compile-time error
public class SubClass extends FinalClass {
    // Class implementation here
}
'''
