About Enums:

Enums are a special type of class that contains a group of constants. 
Enums are used when we know all possible values at compile time, such as choices on a menu, rounding modes, command line flags, etc. 
It is not necessary that the set of constants in an enum type stay fixed for all time. In Java (from 1.5), enums are represented using enum data type. 
Java enums are more powerful than C/C++ enums. In Java, we can also add variables, methods and constructors to it. 
The main objective of enum is to define our own data types(Enumerated Data Types).
